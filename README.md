# CaRdiff-webScraping
Hobby project for CaRdiff R user group on web scraping

If you would like to work with me (Dave), on my project, feel free to fork the repo and make some changes and start submitting pull requests. However, if you want to do your own project crack on and start your own repo, then put a [message in to our meetup group letting us know the location of your repo](https://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/messages/boards/thread/50620825) and we'll come fork it from your profile :)
